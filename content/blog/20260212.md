> the thing is this my friend you can't focus on everything, you can only focus on few things that you give time to, I'm not saying important to you for a reason, as we would love to send our time watching movie, but isn't important for us, so in my opinion, we most of time pick the easy way out, and not the important way out.

But we should go with **important way out**, in my opinion that's makes our life beautiful.

I am such asshole
