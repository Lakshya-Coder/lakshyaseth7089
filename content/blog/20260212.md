> the thing is this my friend you can't focus on everything, you can only focus on few things that you give time to, I'm not saying important to you for a reason, as we would love to send our time watching movie, but isn't important for us, so in my opinion, we most of time pick the easy way out, and not the important way out.

But we should go with **important way out**, in my opinion that's makes our life beautiful.

I am such asshole


Again it's boils down to one thing, जो चीज मुझे पहले से ही आती है, मैं उसे ही apply नहीं कर रहा हूँ, again and again same mistakes repeat कर रहा हु।

I didn't knew this is going to be this hard week, literally I feels like I have abdonded study

from the normal brain, I can't fix up the lost, as I didn't have studied this week, and now on Monday I have the fucking test, now from a average brain I'm totally fucked up, but there should be way which is missing from which I can do it, maybe it's learning the art of the remove things from your life or subtracting things from your life. I know it's hard, and little painfull as you don't have clue about what the fuck you're going to do, but believe me, bro, we can pull this off
