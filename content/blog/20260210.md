Build your definition of everything.

**To be able to create your dream life one day you will have to act like your dream version everyday**

what's my dream life, for the next 1 year:-
- after waking up, instead of watching movies, and social media, focusing on my work, which is study.
- setting up clearly my default mode -> to work and study + and self reflect
- documenting everyday, my life, learning, and action plan.
- adopting mindset, which is whenever felt stuck, asking myself like "what would future and better lakshya would do here in the situation, considering him as a high agency guy" 
- focusing on work + spending time with my family (phone call) and avoid talking to vaibhavi (it's just a emotional damage, in my heart, which never heals)
- 

5 things that I want to fix in my life
1. My porn and masturbation addiction 
2. My addiction to short form media as I don't want the easy route 
3. My health, rn I'm fat
4. Becoming high agency
5. To able to study fearlessly
