**action is the cure of almost everything**

well here the idea to work on, 
1. due to reels and short form content, there is new form of content is emerging, 30 sec story telling videos, which have multiple parts, can may have over than 30 clips
2. so here is my idea, take a old famous movies, chop it into 30 sec clips, upload to your insta page, first our goal should be to get views, and earn following, and there should be our own insta page trademark 
3. then probably take sponsors, to earn money 

**for entirtment, I want to read books, only text from media**, I have said this in my earlier blog, but the thing is that I can't hold up to this
