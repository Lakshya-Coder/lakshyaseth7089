title: time for a change
---

well let's gift myself a new me.

I don't know yet, but one thing is know this week is going to be horryfying week for me, but I want to change things, that I did over and over again over for 2 years, 

so this week is going to be nightmares.

I know, I want to revamp myself compeletly, which may seem like next to impossible, but no matter the cost, there is no fucking option of going back to my old self, and this time, I will not say it only, you will see the effect in the future posts.

well what I want from myslef
1. don't want to indulge into porn and masturbation activities
2. don't watching series, and moives
3. for entirtment, I want to read books, only text from media
4. work on my passion, really build a thinking mind

> Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.

May be I don't need music to heal myself or to talk to someone to heal myself the real thing that I want to do his to spend time alone and understand myself even though being alone comes with lot of consequences like p********** and masturbation, but I think I need to go through this pain alone and understand myself what works for me and if I do to heal myself with music or with some friend maybe I am respecting myself because I am not focusing on the real problem about sourcing it to someone to solve it with is not going to happen because it's my life and I need to take responsibility that's why this week is going to be horrible nightmare, as I have to go with the dark history of myself, which I hated and most regret, so only important thing in my life rn, is to be with me, and solve my own life problem.

> Btw, I'm great at talking with people, you can see this in my previous post
