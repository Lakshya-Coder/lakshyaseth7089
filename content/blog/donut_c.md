title: Maths, and code behind the donut.c by Andy Sloane.

> This the re-creation of following blog: [Link](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html)

At some point, donut.c code went really viral, like everyone on the internet was showcasing on their youtube chanel, and lex fridman too, so I have the real itch to build this from scratch myself, but at that time, I was in the 9th grade, I couldn't able to understand lot of things, I builded, but I was not satisfy with the depth I'm understanding it, now I'm in 11th grade, so I think let's reattempt to build this, and give this a shot, I'm writing this blog along the way, so I can make sure that I'm even understanding.

for future writing references:
    - write roughly about how the code, and works
    - go in depth of the maths, of each concept used,
