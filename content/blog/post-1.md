well hello my name is Lakhsya, rn 17 years old, well I'm trying out new series, in which I'm reflecting my whole life, and putting on this publicly hosted webite.

first big one, how is life lately for me?
easy answer, not very good.

Well I'm a pure addict to masturbation and pornographic content, and short content too, so my my brain doesn't know how to live quietly, may be this will soun an excuess to you, but due to all of the this, I can't study, I fucking can't able to solve problme for even 30 minutes straight, so I'm fukced from both sides, front and back.

So what's the solution, I don't know, you know I'm at a position in which I'm kinda of lossing hope that I would be able to fix my life or not, because I'm deconstructing it, fro about 2 years, and it's relaly tough for me nowdays, back then years were feel like simple and easy to solve mistakes, but the power of compounding has shown it's effect in the real life, I can't bear the pain inside of me, nnot becasue I'm capabale of doing it, but no matter how hard I try, when I sit for doing my coaching homework, I automatically mastubating, and fucking I couldn't able to control it man, and that's my friend fucking depressing for me.

I wanted to be rich af, but if I continue these habits, then prob I will die a worst fucking death.

And the sadest part is that, I first couldn't able to tell my friends and family about it, and then second one if you were to look at me, then I will seem like a totally normal person, how is happy af with his life, it's something known as, pretending who you're not, to double down this, becuase of my average marks, students or peers, don't want to give attention to me, I just wanted a friend, but the person I thought was my friend, seems like, he is just fucking not a friend, I just don't know how fucking emotinal I'm.

i fuckig hate myself right now, but btw I have bought a gift to myself, which is two books. let's see if I would able to read it or not.

I will update it, it upcomming post, but what's the solution for these fucking problems, that I have with myslef,
1. stop consuming media, on yt
2. read more books, and learn from them

problem: when I don't do any thing, I just start mastubating, then it become loop for the worst thing

when I feel like masturbating, I would do study.

they say design your environment.

Urges rise and fall like weather. I don’t have to obey them.

I don’t fight urges. I outgrow them by building a fuller life.

I just need to delay this urge by 10 minutes.

> if you're intelligent, why can't you solve your own problem. this is the sign of the intelligent person.
