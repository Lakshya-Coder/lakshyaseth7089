Well it's very easy to judge someone or something, for example your school farewell didn't go well, now you're blaming on the schools, and it's teachers, forget yours own responsibility, that it should be done by the students, not the teachers, and we all know, most of the teachers aren't interested into organizing farewell, but it's easy to blame on school and teachers, when the fault is ours.

And the funny thing is this, judging someone and jumping to the conclusion happens in a snap of seconds, without you even thinking about it, you just see it, and judge it, jump to conclusion, and instantly judge someone or something, without thinking there should be more than 5 sec on thinking and moving on.

So what's the solution, well first this happens automatically but I think by practice we can change it, so first we need to stop blaming instantly, and ask ourselves, is there more to it that I'm missing right now? if yes then think about it, and maybe don't try to jump to conclusion, give some time, maybe a day, a week, a month, but don't blame, instead understand.

> In the end, you need to accept yourself

I don't know but I am feeling there is a sudden change in my voice and in my attitude, well my voice got l'il deeper, maybe I can pull this of the coaching let's see
