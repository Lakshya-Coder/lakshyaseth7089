There is a constant battle between your focus, most of the urgent things aren't important, and the important things seems very ignorable, hence **we need to protect that can be easily ignored and try to work on them most of the time**, as there is always a new series, new movie, new yt video, new this and that, which seems really important to consume, if you don't then you will die, but often it's not the case.

> **Simple fix:** ask yourself constantly what's the thing that can be easily ignored, and didn't affect yourself instantly (you can bear the consequences of it in the current situation), but it's important
