Build your definition of everything.

**To be able to create your dream life one day you will have to act like your dream version everyday**

what's my dream life, for the next 1 year:-
- after waking up, instead of watching movies, and social media, focusing on my work, which is study.
- setting up clearly my default mode -> to work and study + and self reflect
- documenting everyday, my life, learning, and action plan.
- adopting mindset, which is whenever felt stuck, asking myself like "what would future and better lakshya would do here in the situation, considering him as a high agency guy" 
- focusing on work + spending time with my family (phone call) and avoid talking to vaibhavi (it's just a emotional damage, in my heart, which never heals)
- setting up study as the default mode of time utilization (currently it's been set to series, podcast, shorts), as it just add mental friction to studies
- Becoming proactive problem solver 

5 things that I want to fix in my life
1. My porn and masturbation addiction 
2. My addiction to short form media as I don't want the easy route 
3. My health, rn I'm fat
4. Becoming high agency
5. To able to study fearlessly 
6. ==Well one of the biggest problem and the main problem is this that I don't study and I want to complete my homework that I was assigned to by my teacher or become good at my subjects physics chemistry math==

> **The advice that I fuck ❤️:** अपने में मस्त रहो, जो आप काम करते हो उसमें मस्त रहो

Currently my priority shouldn't be ki that I am getting my work turn or not it should be about that is my default mode is the study or not if I did that then I can put more, hours in, so where the only goal is to make study mode and f*** you that am I getting the my work done or not with if I achieve that level then I will good and I will f*** it and kill it
